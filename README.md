# Signal Analysis
A collection of the projects I made about signal analysis with their relative reports.

### Source Position Identification
The aim of this project is to perform DOA estimation. Simply speaking, we want to identify the angular position with respect to the
midpoint of an array of 16 microphones for a series of time instants by means of delay-and-sum beamformer technique.

### Wave Digital Filter Implementation
The aim of this project is to implement a Wave Digital Filter on Matlab. In the specific case, the WDF model of the equivalent circuit of the MXR Distortion+ guitar pedal.
